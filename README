INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    make initdb
        Only run this the first time you install this module.

        If you run this twice, you will end up with duplicate data in your
        database.

        If you are upgrading this module, check for upgrading instructions
        in case changes need to be made to your database.

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::Assets));

        or add "RT::Extension::Assets" to your existing @Plugins line.

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

METHODS ADDED TO OTHER CLASSES
  RT::CustomField::LoadByNameAndCatalog (Catalog => CATALOGID, Name => NAME)
    Loads the Custom field named NAME.

    Will load a Disabled Custom Field even if there is a non-disabled Custom
    Field with the same Name.

    If a Catalog parameter is specified, only look for asset custom fields
    tied to that Catalog.

    If the Catalog parameter is '0', look for global asset custom fields.

    If no Catalog parameter is specified, look for any and all custom fields
    with this name, limiting the results to catalog/asset CFs.

  RT::CustomFields::LimitToCatalog (CATALOGID)
    Takes a numeric "CATALOGID", and limits the Custom Field collection to
    those only applied directly to it; this limit is OR'd with other
    "LimitToCatalog" and "LimitToGlobal" limits.

    Note that this will cause the collection to only return asset CFs.
