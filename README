METHODS ADDED TO OTHER CLASSES
  RT::CustomField
   LoadByNameAndCatalog
    Loads the described asset custom field, if one is found, into the
    current object. This method only consults custom fields applied to
    RT::Catalog for RT::Asset objects.

    Takes a hash with the keys:

    Name
        A RT::CustomField ID or Name which applies to assets.

    Catalog
        Optional. An RT::Catalog ID or Name.

    If Catalog is specified, only a custom field added to that Catalog will
    be loaded.

    If Catalog is 0, only global asset custom fields will be loaded.

    If no Catalog is specified, all asset custom fields are searched
    including global and catalog-specific CFs.

    Please note that this method may load a Disabled custom field if no
    others matching the same criteria are found. Enabled CFs are
    preferentially loaded.

  RT::CustomFields
   LimitToCatalog
    Takes a numeric RT::Catalog ID. Limits the RT::CustomFields collection
    to only those fields applied directly to the specified catalog. This
    limit is OR'd with other "LimitToCatalog" and "LimitToGlobal" calls.

    Note that this will cause the collection to only return asset CFs.
